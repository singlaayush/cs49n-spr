 * sonar, hc-sr04
 *
 * the comments on the sparkfun product page might be helpful.
 *
 * Pay attention to the voltages on:
 *	- Vcc
 *	- Vout.
 * 
 * When circuit is "open" it can be noisy --- is it high or low when open?
 * If high need to configure a pin to be a pullup, if low, pulldown to reject
 * noise.

	// put your code here.  
	//
	// you'll need to:
	// 	1. init the device (pay attention to time delays here)
	//
	//	2. do a send (again, pay attention to any needed time 
	// 	delays)
	//
	//	3. measure how long it takes and compute round trip
	//	by converting that time to distance using the datasheet
	// 	formula
	//
	// 	4. use the code in gpioextra.h and then replace it with your
	//	own (using the broadcom pdf in the docs/ directory).
	// 
	// troubleshooting:
	//	1. readings can be noisy --- you may need to require multiple
	//	high (or low) readings before you decide to trust the 
	// 	signal.
	//
	// 	2. there are conflicting accounts of what value voltage you
	//	need for Vcc.
	//	
	// 	3. the initial 3 page data sheet you'll find sucks; look for
	// 	a longer one.
